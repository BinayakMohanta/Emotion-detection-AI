📌 Emotion Detection AI using Deep Learning
🚀 Emotion Detection AI is a deep learning model built using MobileNetV2 to classify human facial emotions. The dataset is stored in Google Drive and trained in Google Colab using a GPU for faster training.

📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of facial images categorized into 7 emotion classes:
😃 Happy | 😡 Angry | 😢 Sad | 😨 Fearful | 😲 Surprised | 😐 Neutral | 🤢 Disgusted

The dataset is divided into train and test folders.
Images are resized to 96x96 pixels for better accuracy.
📌 Features
✔️ Uses MobileNetV2 for efficient and fast training.
✔️ Data Augmentation applied for improved generalization.
✔️ Trained in Google Colab using a GPU (Tesla T4 or P100).
✔️ Test Accuracy: ~70-85% after training for 15-25 epochs.
